# MOBILITY IN IP NETWORKS

The ip network infrastructure is not suitable for handling mobile nodes cause:

*the foundamental block of an ip network, the ip address serves as a identification mechanism and a locator in order to route the packets*

So due to the nature of an ip network, a mobile node  that changes frequently network changes also is ip address and the packets needs to be routed to the new destination

there are 2 possible solution to handle the problem:

- **location update** the network infrastructure is informed of the mobile node position
- **location search** the network infrastructure search and updates the node position
