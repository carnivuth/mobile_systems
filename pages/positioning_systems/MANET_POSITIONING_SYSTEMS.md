# MANET POSITIONING SYSTEMS
## ASSUMPTION BASED COORDINATES (ABC)

ABC is a positioning system for a [manet](MANETS.md) environment, it relies on the concept of **anchor node**.
Each anchor node compute the relative distance between himself and the one-hop nodes around him and maintains an internal map

## TRIANGULATION VIA EXTENDED RANGE AND REDUNDANT ASSOCIATION OF INTERMEDIATE NODES (TERRAIN)

This solution relies on exploiting the maps of the anchor nodes to create a multi hop map of the nodes position
