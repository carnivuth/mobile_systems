# BLUETOOTH (IEEE 802.15.1)

Protocol for PAN communication, based on 2.4 frequencies band,it aims to the following goals:

- low cost device
- low distance communication
- voice and data management

This comes with the cost of lower bandwidth so lower data transfer rate

## PROTOCOL STACK

Bluetooth is a complex stack of protocols at different layer and devices can implement only a subset of functionality and not all

## ARCHITECTURE

Bluetooth architecture is called PICO-NET where a node plays the role of master and manages the communication with the other nodes and between nodes

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[MASTER]
B[node]
C[node]
D[node]
A --> B & D & C
```

Where:

- there is always a **unique master node**
- maximum of 7 active nodes
- communication happens on a single channel using [frequency hopping](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-hopping_spread_spectrum)

## PREPARATION PHASE

In order to communicate 2 nodes need to complete a **preparation phase** in order to construct the topology, this phase is spit in 2 sub-phases:

- **INQUIRY PHASE** a node start the discovery of nearby nodes and become the master
- **PAGING PHASE** master establish a bidirectional communication channel in frequency hopping with the slave nodes

```mermaid

A((master))
end

B((slave1))
C((slave2))
D((slave3))
end
subgraph nodes out of range
E((node1))
F((node2))
end
A --> B
A --> C
A --> D
```

One of the main constraint of Bluetooth communication is that **nodes need to have their clock synchronized**, this is done by imposing the master clock to the slaves that adapts their clocks

## COMMUNICATION WITH MASTER

Time is divided by time slots in which only 2 nodes can communicate This is done in order to avoid collisions

The master decide which node can communicate, the master can communicate in all the odd slots

### SCO CHANNELS

SCO packets are sent in pre-allocated time slots, in order to guarantee a fixed bandwidth (must have for audio streaming applications)

In order to avoid the consumption of all time slots the master can establish 3 SCO channels at the same time

In this mode re transmissions are not allowed
### ACL CHANNELS

ACL packets are best effort communication with no guaranteed bandwidth this allow for higher bandwidth, it also support asymmetric bandwidth allocation for the  2 directions

In this connection types the slave can transmit only if in the previous time slot has received a packet from the master

In this mode retransmissions are allowed

## MULTI HOP COMMUNICATION (SCATTER NET)

Bluetooth supports communication between PICO-NETs if the range allows it

```mermaid
flowchart TD
subgraph piconet1
A[1]
B[2]
C[3]
end
subgraph piconet2
D[4]
E[5]
F[6]
end
A <--> B & C
D <--> E & F
A <--> D
```

In this configuration a node for each net is selected as the gateway that can forward traffic to the other net. This is a possibility allowed by the protocol but it's not implemented for performance reasons

## SERVICE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL

Bluetooth has a discovery protocol in order to identify nodes in the range, this allows also to discover what service the device can offer

## BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY BLE

Improvements in energy consumption with the same performances different set of channels (40 2-MHz channels). Within a channel, data is transmitted using Gaussian frequency shift modulation. Bitrate is 1 Mbit/s, and the maximum transmit power is 10 mW

The main difference is in the protocol of discovery and advertisement on the availability for piconets which is based on discovery packet broadcasting

All **BLE** devices implements the generic attribute (GATT) profile

## BLUETOOTH VS [WIFI](WIFI.md)

| WIFI                                        | BLUETOOTH                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| multi node communication                    | point to point communication only                           |
| no discovery needed                         | need of discovery phase in order to communicate with a node |
| communication can be done in broadcast mode | no efficient broadcast support                              |
