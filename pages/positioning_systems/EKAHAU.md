# EKAHAU

Positioning system that exploits a stochastic model of the environment to compute position avoiding the signal measurement error, the approach is based on [scene analysis](BASE_TECHNIQUES.md#SCENE%20ANALYSIS) approach

One of the improvements over [RADAR](RADAR.md) is the rail tracking principle that computes position based on the most recent calculated one and by following allowed paths (*e.g. no wallk trough walls*)
