# INTRODUCTION

Focus:  good software engineering practice for  mobile systems development

using middle-ware supports to avoid reinventing the wheel from the beginning example of mobile applications that run on a support platform (IOS) or (ANDROID)

Android middle-ware composed by operating system capabilities and various runtime supports? (java runtime, DOTNET runtime)

mobile system development requires knowledge that in other situation is not needed (ex knowledge of physical communication medium capabilities) 

in this field performance requirements can be more important, time constraint can not be ignored

## FIRST PART

communication protocols with the focus in 

- pro and cons for application layer
- comprension of why using a technology instead of another

also 3d layer protocols cause in a lot of cases IP is not something that can be used

## SECOND PART

Focus on mobile middle-ware concept

- why the need of a middle-ware
