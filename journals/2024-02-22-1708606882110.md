# INTERESTING PROJECTS AND SCENARIOS

- distributed databases in cars for terrorist tracking
- generalization of WiFi tethering with n device m different connection technologies 

## some problems require considerations about the system where it runs

## no need to reinvent the wheel when there is no need to do so

# DIGITAL TWIN

industrial manufacturing line that can communicate  and collect data that builds a program that can improve based on predictions the production line, the system can review it's self

These twins are made of 2 parts

- simulator that make predictions
- sensors that inputs data to correct the simulations (data driven decision making)

some mobile systems problems came up for example

- communication probles
- law and privacy problems
- edge computing requirements
- computer vision problems

### DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL TWINS

systems that use a combination of cloud and real sensor systems to build digital twins

## CLOUD ASSISTED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE

Systems that detects obstacles and communicates the information to other vehicles in order to avoid collisions
