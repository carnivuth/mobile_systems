**DIGITAL TWIN**

Industrial manufacturing line that can communicate and collect data that builds a program, which in turn can improve the production line based on predictions. The systems can do self-reviewing (can review itself).

DT consists in 2 parts:

- **simulator** that make predictions;
- **sensors** that collect data to correct the simulations (data driven decision making)

Within the Cloud, due to latency, throughput, connectivity, costs, and security only a restricted class of IoT/IIoT applications that are compatible with the cloud-centric mode.

A Distributed Digital Twin is a replication of a physical system in a digital platform. Unlike a standard Digital Twin, it is spread across multiple locations and platforms (combination of Cloud and DT). Each of these distributed parts work in coordination with each other to provide comprehensive insights about the physical system. This allows for more robust and resilient data analysis, as the distributed nature reduces reliance on a single point of failure.

**OVERVIEW ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS**

To be able to build efficient apps on top of MS it is important to talk about the protocols used, in particular the ISO/OSI protocols stack.

_1 – The physical layer (Layer 1)_

MS use Wireless communication, and in Wireless communication a node can communicate if it’s close to the source of the signal. In wired communication, this doesn’t happen, because of switches, amplifiers, repeaters, …, which regenerate/redirect the signal through the destination.

In wireless communication, the power with which the signal is propagated depends on the distance between the communicating device and the Access Point: the more the distance increases, the more the power decreases. It’s not possible to regenerate the wireless signal, in some cases: it depends on a particular threshold (T0) over which receivers can recognize the wireless signal (remember that they recognize _0s and 1s_).

Let’s start with an example. Imagine that you placed an AP in your home, and you want to know how much the signal can be propagated. We expect that the signal power will decrease if the distance from the AP increases. But why? All comes from the **MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS:**

-        **Free-space loss** (the signal power decreases alongside the square of the distance)**:  
						$P_{r}\simeq P_{t}G_{t}G_{r}(\frac{\lambda }{4\pi d})^2$ 

-        **Plane earth loss** (the signal power decreases alongside the fourth power of the distance)**:**

						$P_{r}\simeq P_{t}G_{t}G_{r}(\frac{h_{t}h_{r}}{d^2})^2$

In real or realistic scenarios, actual conditions are far more complex; this pushes, as very frequently occurs in engineering, towards **approximated empirical models**:

-        **Plane earth loss**:

-        **Okumura-Hata**

-        **COST-231-Hata**

-        **COST-231-Walfisch-Ikegami**

-        **Indoor propagation models**

-        **Ray-tracing-based propagation models (geometric optics and diffraction)**

The behavior is far more complicated because there are some types of channel fadings, physically due to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. The three most important ones are:




1) **Shadowing** (or slow fading) – When a signal encounters an obstacle it tends to be total absorbed  and partially reflected by the latter.  
The behavior of the obstacle can be described by a probability distribution function (pdf):  

![](clip_image012.jpg)


From pdf, we can determine **U(P0)**, which is the **probability of being in the coverage area** (percentage of the coverage area with received signal power strength greater than P0)  
![](clip_image014.jpg)
From these graphs, we can see that pdf à 1 even if we’re close to the signal source.

2)  **Multipath Rayleigh fading** – It occurs when there is an obstacle between sender and receiver. We would be taken to think that if the obstacle absorbed the signal strength, then the recipient would not receive nothing. However, Rayleigh discovered that since some of the signal still passes over the obstacle (even if in different directions than where the recipient is), it could be reflected by two additional obstacles, so that in the end the signal comes anyway to the position where the receiver is placed.

3)     **Frequency-selective fading**

In addition, we can have also other effects, like:

·       Doppler Effect;

·       Time-selective fading;

·       Ricean fading;

·       Nagakami fading;

·       Suzuki fading;

·       **Scattering** - of radiation or particle beams due to interaction with matter

·       Absobtion of radiation by the atmosphere

In conclusion, when using any kid of wireless connectivity protocol, we can say that there are no precise models for the propagation of signals in real cases, but we have a only empirical and/or probabilistic models available. This is due to variations in the atmosphere, number of obstacles and their locations, etc.

- free-space loss: $P_{r}\simeq P_{t}G_{t}G_{r}(\frac{\lambda }{4\pi d})^2$ 
- plane earth loss: $P_{r}\simeq P_{t}G_{t}G_{r}(\frac{h_{t}h_{r}}{d^2})^2$ 

In this type of communications there are problems due to distance of the device and signal propagation physical laws. a mobile system with performance constraint need to account that

At a certain distance signal are to weak to be distinguished by noise, the signal is lost

from the previous formulas the signal power decreases alongside the square of distance

This models are not useful in real scenarios that are far more complicated so the focus shifts more towards empirical models

![](Pasted%20image%2020240222162731.png)

in Real world scenarios the power received from a device can be a lot more strange than what equations predict
This strange behavior is due to a phenomenon called **shadowing**, this is modeled by a probabilistic function of the power received

![](Pasted%20image%2020240222163341.png)

With this model there is no certain that the signal is always be comprehensible, so this implies that there will be always the need of re-transmission and so no bandwidth is guaranteed 

## REFLECTIONS

![](Pasted%20image%2020240222163915.png)

no model is suitable to compute this situations

## DOPPLER EFFECT 

Due to the fact that nodes can move relative to each others

## SCATTERING AND ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION

### WIRELESS COMMUNICATION CAN BE AFFECTED BY A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS BUT THE MEAN BEHAVIOR IS TO DECREASE ALONG WITH THE SQUARE OF **DISTANCE***

Layer 2 technologies must account for this nature of the medium
