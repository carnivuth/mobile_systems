# MESSAGING SYSTEMS 

Based on the concept of decoupling the two endpoints of the connections in order to overcome the mobility of the 2 nodes, (tcp connection migrations ecc...)

This approach tends to separate clearly the communication so that the  2 nodes does not communicate directly with each other but communicate whit an intermediate node that store the message until the other node is ready for receive the message
