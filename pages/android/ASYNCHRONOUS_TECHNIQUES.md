# ANDROID ASYNCHRONOUS TECHNIQUES

The android platform offers multiple ways to run tasks in concurrency with the main activity

- **Thread**
- **Executor**
- **HandlerThread**
- **AsyncTask**
- **Service** (*already partially discussed*)
- **IntentService**
- **AsyncQueryHandler**
- **Loader**

## SERVICE

Service are components that **share the application main thread** and can perform long running tasks with **no user interaction**, they are triggered by application intent

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A(call to start service)
B[onCreate]
subgraph active lifetime
C[onStartCommand]
D(service Running)
end
E[onDestroy]
F(service is destroyed)
A --> B --> C --> D --the service is stopped by client or itself--> E --> F
```

a service expose a client server interface for application to bind and send requests, when all applications are unbounded the service is terminated

### FOREGROUND SERVICES

more priority than background services but the user must be aware that they exists (*e.g. music players*)

### INTENT SERVICES

Use a set of worker thread to fullfill requests and stops when done, also lifecicle is simplified

## THREADS

Similar to the java threads main differences are:

- they cannot be destroyed by the invocation of `destroy`
- they cannot work with the user interface

## HANDLER

associated with a thread and is message queue, it delivers/handle messages and can be used to schedule tasks or interact with other threads queue

## ASYNC TASK

It's created in the UI thread and work in a background thread, the **results is published in the UI thread**

it accepts 3 parameters:

- **Params**, the type of the parameters sent to the async task upon execution
- **Progress**, the type of the progress units published during the background computation
- **Result**, the type of the result of the background computation

it goes through some phases:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
subgraph UI_thread
direction TB
A(onPreExecute)
C(onProgressUpdate)
D(onPostExecute)
A ~~~ C ~~~ D
end
subgraph background_thread
B(doInBackgroud)
end
A --> B --after call to publishProgress--> C
UI_thread ~~~ background_thread
```

## WHY ONLY ONE THREAD TO MANAGE UI?

The android UI toolkit is not thread safe so manipulation in concurrent threads are not guaranteed to be consistent
