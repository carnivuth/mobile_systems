# NO INFRASTRUCTURE POSITIONING SYSTEMS

There are also solutions to compute position of an object without dedicated hardware

## GSM BASED POSITIONING SYSTEMS

There are possible techniques of positioning based on the GSM infrastructure:

- **Enhanced observed time difference**  exploits the number of base stations in visibility (*3 minimum*)
- **Timing advance** this technique exploits handover

## BLUETOOTH BASED POSITIONING SYSTEMS

One possible solution is to exploits the limited range of Bluetooth devices and is low costs to implement a [proximity](BASE_TECHNIQUES.md#PROXIMITY) based positioning system.

One possible solution is to place Bluetooth devices at the point of interests (PoI) and devices can compute their position by connecting to a BT POI and computing the RSSI

This method allow different levels of privacy for the device that can scan in silent mode the PoI
